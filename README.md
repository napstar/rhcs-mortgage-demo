App Dev Cloud with JBoss Mortgage Demo 
======================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Suite Mortgage Demo in the Cloud based on leveraging the Red Hat 
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).  It delivers a fully functioning JBoss BPM Mortgage example containerized on OCP.


Install JBoss Mortgage on OpenShift
-----------------------------------
1. First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the following installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/rhcs-mortgage-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Download JBoss EAP & JBoss BPM Suite, add to installs directory (see installs/README).

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.
```

Log in to JBoss Rewards to start exploring an online employee rewards application (the address will be generated by the init
script):

  - OCP example: http://rhcs-mortgage-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/business-central ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )


Notes
-----
To clone a repository in the running container, the following actions would need to occur from a developer's machine.

1. Execute port forwarding through the OpenShift CLI. This will open a tunnel between the developer's machine and the pod through
	 the OpenShift API pod proxy. The command window will block while the session is open:

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-mortgage-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 9418:9418

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-mortgage-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 8001:8001
   ```

2. Clone the repository. In another window, clone the remote repository after logging in to Business Central, creating a repository
	 and identifying the repository URL in the Admin Perspective (this example is a BackOffice repository):

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:9418/Mortgages

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:8001/Mortgages
   ```

The following functionality is covered:

- One advanced process.

- Four Human Tasks assigned to 3 different roles

- Use of Swimlanes to assign a task to the user who previously took ownership

- Several guide business rules

- Several technical rules

- A guided web decision table

- Several Script Tasks for Java work

- One Web Service task using SOAP/HTTP

- Exclusive use of the BPMS Data Modeler for creating the Java fact model

- Use of graphic form designer to create 4 forms with an example of javascript validation

- Helper jar to pre-load with sixteen process instances in various states.

For 'Appraisal' task only, any claimed tasks that are not competed within a minute will be reassigned automatically back into the group for processing.

Note that the entire demo is running default in memory, restart server, lose your process instances, data, monitoring history.

Sources for the demo client jar can be found in the projects directory.
